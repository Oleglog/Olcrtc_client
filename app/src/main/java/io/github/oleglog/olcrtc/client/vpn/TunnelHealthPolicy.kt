/**
 * Issue #48: tunnel liveness policy in one place.
 *
 * The tunnel is considered alive when real application traffic flows
 * (byte counters move). When idle, [TUNNEL_HEALTH_INTERVAL_MILLIS] of
 * silence triggers an active probe: a DNS query through the tunnel for
 * each of [DATAPATH_DNS_NAMES] (one success is enough, so a single dead
 * name cannot force a reconnect) plus an HTTPS HEAD through the local
 * SOCKS for each of [DATAPATH_HTTPS_URLS]. The tunnel counts as healthy
 * when any DNS name resolves OR any HTTPS URL answers 204; only when
 * both families fail does [healthProbeFailures] grow, and
 * [HEALTH_FAILURES_BEFORE_RECONNECT] consecutive failures reconnect.
 *
 * Probe targets are chosen for reachability from Russian mobile networks:
 * the gstatic/ubuntu captive-check endpoints answer lightweight 204s
 * worldwide, and ya.ru / vk.com are the highest-traffic domestic hosts
 * (SimilarWeb/Semrush July 2026: yandex.ru #1, vk.com/vk.ru top-10).
